# PathFinding
A C# Pathfinding library built to try and be general enough for most 2D based path finding requirements. The goal is to build a solution that can handle large amounts of entities moving around a map at once. The implementation is built around time splicing the Dijkstra (used for what I have called undirected paths) and A* (used for what I have called directed paths) algorithms.

# Use
Included is a Unity Demo where an implementation of a simple scenario is shown which demonstrates a simple use case for the library. The library is ready for use for basic path finding needs or for learning reasons at the user own discretion.

# Future
This demo may evolve to include concepts of path finding such as local obstacle avoidance, path smoothing, group movement etc.
